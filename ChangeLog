 The conversion of types to JSON no longer takes a request as the first parameter. This allows objects to be converted without having to do it within the context of a request.
 Added JSON handler for the server side of the field type NullBooleanField.
 Fixed a bug where the user agent would sign the wrong POST data.
 The update operation no longer returns a redirect.
 Many to many fields now appear in the data arrays section of the instance fields rather than with the other fields.
 The user agent POST requester can now be provided with a list of status codes that it will accept as successful and if it cannot parse the JSON body it will return an empty dict.

 Fixed a problem where forwarded authentication could lead to an infinite recursion error.

2012-04-13  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Try to be much stricter about which applications get which models. This fixes a problem where models were associated with applications that made use of them, rather than just the one that defined them.

2012-04-05  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 The authentication forwarding backend is now properly compatible with the real Fost authn request signing.
 The type of the user_id that we see is important as it tells us what we need to look it up with.

2012-04-02  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Requests are now signed when going back to another service.
 Added a Realm to the WWW-Authentication header.

 Better error responses are returned to the client based on a number of exceptions that might be thrown.

2012-03-23  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>

2012-02-18  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Added a proxy method for the model create operation. This has also changed the data returned by the old create operation.
 Added CSRF bypassing on the Slumber views (if the version of Django uses CSRF).
 Internal services now get the application directly rather than what would have been the service root.

2012-02-17  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Added tests for Django 1.4.
 Added an incomplete version of a new configuration that will allow specific Django applications to be exposed on specific service names.

2012-01-30  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Forced the model URL used for the type name to be a str as some Windows boxes seem to get Unicode strings for the URLs where most machines gets normal Python strings.

2012-01-16  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 The server side conversion to JSON compatible Python objects now includes the request so that, for example, URIs can be handled correctly.
 The Slumber configuration now also allows us to add in JSON transform functions for specific types for when property values are processed.

2012-01-12  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Renamed the slumber_test folder to slumber_examples.
 Added the beginnings of the server side configuration by allowing model properties to be exposed.

2011-12-29  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Fixed the license information in the setup tags.
 Removed the .idea files generated by some IDE.

2011-12-02  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 The authentication back end now copies across the attribute values and resets them on the local user each time the user is fetched from the backend.

2011-11-29  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Added HTTP caching that can be controlled on a per-model basis.
 The POST method in the connector user agent now also creates a new Http object for each request.

2011-11-28  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Changed the model `get` operation so that it returns the data directly without doing a redirect first thus saving a HTTP request.
 Get requests from the client will now get retried up to three times.
 Added an implementation for get_profile which will bring the profile from the auth service to the auth client.

2011-11-02  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Fixed a bug where the Django session would result in the wrong user, or a failed log in when the remote and local users had different primary key values.

2011-11-02  Chokchai Phatharamalai  <juacompe@proteus-tech.com>
 Changed the way that Httplib2 is used so that the same Http object is no longer re-used. This should improve reliability, but will have a (hopefully minimal) impact on performance.

2011-10-26  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Allow an authentication request to be passed on to another auth service elsewhere.

2011-10-20  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>

 Added in the ability to handle multiple services spread across multiple Django projects.

2011-09-06  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Added a User operation that allows permissions to be checked.

2011-08-27  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 Added an instance cache together with some cache flushing middleware. This should improve the efficiency of the cache and reduce the number of requests to fetch objects from the back end.

2011-08-25  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
 We are now able to authenticate Django Users.

2011-08-22  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>

2011-08-05  Kirit Saelensminde  <kirit@felspar.com>
